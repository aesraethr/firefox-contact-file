# Import contacts from sdcard

Two ways of importing, all the info stored and also it provides the ability to import
contacts that have a phone number.
This last option is recommended as long as you will have contacts just with email
address and so on.

It allows you to import contact from an export from any source (ie: thunderbird, google, ios contacts...)
